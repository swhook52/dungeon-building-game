# Player Roles

## Dungeon Master Role

### Building
The master can select rooms to build from a list of preset rooms and add them to their dungeon. Each room has a cost. 

### Currency
The dungeon master currency is blood. They need blood to pay for the creation of the rooms. Each dungeon has a blood line to get a constant stream of blood. These are creatures/minions/hostages/pricesses that will give you a small amount of blood all the time. You can optionally sacrifice one or more of them for a quick blood dump but you will no longer have the incremental blood reward.

## Hero Role
As the hero, you are interested in getting rich quick. You need to get into the dungeon, get the loot and get out.

### Character selection
The hero may select from a list of players that have varying abilities/stats that will slightly weight the gameplay based on that character's style of play.

### Currency
The hero uses loot to purchase abilities. Loot is aquired by successfully navigating a dungeon and exiting with the dungeon's loot. Still need a mechanic to slowly get loot even if you don't survive the dungeon.

### Abilities
Need some examples
